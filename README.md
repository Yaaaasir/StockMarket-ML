# Stock Price Prediction of Apple Inc. (2012-2023)
This project explores the application of various machine learning models to predict the closing stock price of Apple Inc. over an 11-year period, from 2012 to 2023. The primary goal is to develop accurate predictive models using historical stock price data.

Models Implemented
Four machine learning models were evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting stock prices:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network particularly well-suited for sequential data, such as stock prices, due to its ability to learn temporal dependencies.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): While primarily used for image processing, CNNs can be adapted to time series data with proper transformations, allowing for the capture of complex patterns.
Random Forest Regressor: A versatile and robust model that handles non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data, making it ideal for financial predictions.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): A model capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data, although sensitive to parameter tuning.
Data
The stock price data used in this study includes Apple's daily closing prices over the specified time period. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on stock data from other major tech companies—Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—to assess trends, patterns, and relationships across the tech sector.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the models, a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to:

Assess data quality and integrity
Identify patterns and trends in the stock prices
Explore potential correlations between different tech stocks
EDA ensures that the data used for modeling is reliable and offers meaningful insights, laying the groundwork for robust machine learning models.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide investors and financial analysts with valuable insights into Apple's stock price trends, aiding in informed decision-making. By comparing the performance of various machine learning models, this project aims to demonstrate the potential of these models in financial market forecasting and enhancing investment strategies.

Conclusion
This research contributes to the growing field of machine learning applications in financial markets, showing the potential for advanced techniques to predict stock prices with increased accuracy and reliability.
